= ReportsAsSparkline

ReportsAsSparkline enables you to generate reports and sparklines from your model's data with very little effort.

== Usage

If you hace a +User+ model with +created_at+ and +activated_at+ columns, you can just add +reports_as_sparkline+
to it with the following options:

* :date_column - The name of the date column on that the records are aggregated
* :value_column - The name of the column that holds the value to sum for aggregation :sum
* :aggregation - The aggregation to use (one of :count, :sum, :minimum, :maximum or :average); when using anything other than :count, :value_column must also be specified (<b>If you really want to e.g. sumon the 'id' column, you have to explicitely say so.</b>)
* :grouping - The period records are grouped on (:hour, :day, :week, :month); <b>Beware that reports_as_sparkline treats weeks as starting on monday!</b>
* :limit - The number of periods to get (see :grouping)
* :conditions - Conditions like in ActiveRecord::Base#find; only records that match there conditions are reported on
* :cumulate - Sets whether to cumulate the numbers (instead of [1, 2, 3] returns [1, 3, 6])
* :live_data - Specified whether data for the current reporting period is read; if :live_data is true, you will experience a performance hit since the request cannot be satisfied from the cache only (defaults to false)

<b>Example:</b>

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    reports_as_sparkline :registrations
    reports_as_sparkline :activations,  :date_column => :activated_at
    reports_as_sparkline :total_users,  :cumulate    => true
  end

This will add the following class methods to your User model:

  User.registrations_report
  User.activations_report
  User.total_users_report

When invoking the report, you can override some of the options you specified for +reports_as_sparkline+:

* :grouping - The period records are grouped on (:hour, :day, :week, :month)
* :limit - The number of periods to get (see :grouping)
* :conditions - Conditions like in ActiveRecord::Base#find; only records that match there conditions are reported on
* :live_data - Specified whether data for the current reporting period is read; if :live_data is true, you will experience a performance hit since the request cannot be satisfied from the cache only (defaults to false)

<b>Example:</b>

  User.registrations_report(:conditions => ['last_name LIKE 'A%'])
  User.activations_report(:grouping => :week, :limit => 5)

<b>Beware that when specifying conditions on invocation of the report, the cache will not be used!</b>

You can than render sparklines for these reports with sparkline_tag in your view:

  <%= sparkline_tag(User.registrations_report) %>

The +sparkline_tag+ helper takes the following parameters:

* width - The width of the generated image
* height - The height of the generated image
* line_color - The line color of the sparkline (hex code)
* fill_color - The color to fill the area below the sparkline with (hex code)
* labes - The axes to render lables for (Array of :x, :y, :r, :t; this is x axis, y axis, right, top)

== Installation

Installation requires 3 simple steps:

<b>get the plugin</b>

From your RAILS_ROOT in Rails &gt;= 2.1, do

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/mk/reports_as_sparkline.git

If you are on Rails &lt; 2.1, do this from your RAILS_ROOT

  git clone git://github.com/mk/reports_as_sparkline.git vendor/plugins/reports_as_sparkline

<b>generate migration</b>

  ./script/generate reports_as_sparkline_migration add_reports_as_sparkline_tables

<b>migrate</b>

  rake db:migrate

== Performance

To achieve best performance, you should add indices to your tables on the date columns that are
used for grouping the records (see Kvlr::ReportsAsSparkline::ClassMethods.reports_as_sparkline):

  add_index :[table], :[date_column]

If you are on PostgreSQL, you should add functional indices:

  add_index :[table], :[date_column], :functional => "date_trunc('hour', [date_column])"
  add_index :[table], :[date_column], :functional => "date_trunc('day',  [date_column])"
  add_index :[table], :[date_column], :functional => "date_trunc('week', [date_column])"
  add_index :[table], :[date_column], :functional => "date_trunc('year', [date_column])"

== TODOs/ future plans

* support for Oracle and DB2 (and others?) missing
* Implement data ranges in arguments
* Limit number of data points to maximum that the google chart api allows
* Make graph styling configurable
